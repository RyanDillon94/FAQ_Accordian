## Overview
- Third Front-End Mentor challenge and the first one that included JavaScript. Enjoyed the extra complexity!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

- HTML built on mobile, with CSS and JS built on a laptop.
- Started with the HTML and built the browser view first with CSS. Hid all the inactive <p> tags to work on alignment and struggled a little with the plus/minus icons.
- Once everything was good with the styling I began with the JS.
- Changing the class was easy enough as something i have done recently. Ensuring there was only one 'active' class was a little tricky.
- The transition was messy and clunky, spent waaayyyy too long on this and in the end gave up with a clunky css transition.
- Checked other solutions on the challenge and spotted a JS transition.
- After some research ans struggling i caved and asked ChatGPT to write me a transition function.

### Built with

- VSCode
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned
- Used Chrome dev tools a lot for this one, very useful and dont think i would have managed the styling without it. Very useful to play around with the flex properties.

### Continued development

- Need to continue with my JavaScript development. I knew the basics but no idea when it came to the transition.
